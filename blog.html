    <h2>Values, Strengths & Struggles</h2>
    <p>
      Before I started this course, I never thought I’d be sitting here writing
      a blog about values and self-reflection. I’ve spent most of my adult life
      working with my hands, building cars/engines, fabrication and driving
      trucks, figuring things out the hard way. But this learning journey is
      already pushing me in different ways, not just with tech, but with how I
      see myself.
    </p>

    <h2>A Time I Had to Make a Call</h2>
    <p>
      A while back, my best mate told me his partner had cheated on him. I just
      kept quiet. I didn’t want to get in the middle of their relationship, and
      honestly, I thought, “It’s his life, he’ll figure it out.” But then it
      happened again. I could see how much it was messing with him, and I
      couldn’t just sit on the fence anymore. I told him straight, “Bro, I’m not
      gonna tell you what to do, but I’ll be really disappointed if you get back
      with her again.” It wasn’t about judging him or pushing him away. I just
      care about him, and it hurt seeing him going back to someone who didn’t
      respect him. I said it from a place of loyalty, not control, it’s his life
      after all. I didn’t want to stay silent and watch him go through the same
      heartbreak and mental games again without saying anything. Looking back,
      I’m glad I said something. He ended up walking away from her, and later
      told me that conversation helped him finally see it for what it was.
      Sometimes being a good mate means saying the hard stuff, even when you
      know it might hurt.

    <h2>My Culture & The People Around Me</h2>
    <p>
      I grew up in West Auckland, bouncing between different places. It was a
      mixed environment, some good, some rough, but it was full of real people.
      I didn’t have much guidance growing up and ended up moving into my own
      place at 16/17. That taught me to figure things out on my own early. I
      still feel like I’m trying to figure things out. Even without a clear
      path, I always had this feeling deep down that things like family,
      respect, and staying humble actually mattered. You show up, do your part,
      and look out for others, that’s what stuck with me. Most of the people
      around me were friends and workers, just doing what they had to do. Being
      around them shaped the way I think. You don’t get respect from talking
      big, you earn it by work ethic, how you treat people and how you carry
      yourself, day in and day out.
    </p>

    <h2>Strengths I Bring to the Table</h2>
    <p>
      I don’t give up easily. I’ve been pushed, over worked, and still managed
      to show up the next day and keep pushing. I also love figuring things out
      even if it takes me awhile. That curiosity keeps me going when the code
      isn’t working or when I hit a wall. Another strength is I know when I
      don’t know something. I’ve got no shame in asking for help. I’d rather
      learn properly than pretend I’ve got it sorted.
    </p>

    <h2>The Things I Struggle With</h2>
    <p>
      I overthink. Simple as that. Sometimes I get in my own head, trying to
      make things perfect instead of just getting something finished. That slows
      me down. Also, I didn’t grow up coding or using computers much, so
      sometimes I feel like I’m behind. Like everyone else already knows things
      I don’t. But I’m learning to ignore that voice and just focus on getting a
      bit better every day.
    </p>

    <h2>Working With Others Under Pressure</h2>
    <p>
      At my current job, there’s a female worker on the team who would often get
      overwhelmed when things got busy. She’d get flustered and stressed out,
      and I struggled to relate. For me, I don’t see work as something to stress
      over. At the end of the day, it’s just a job, it’s not my company, (maybe
      id feel differently if it was) and I’ve always felt like my energy is
      better spent on my family and the things that really matter in life. At
      first, I didn’t really understand her reaction. I thought, “Why’s she
      letting this get to her?” But over time, I realised that not everyone sees
      things the way I do, and some people genuinely feel that pressure more. I
      didn’t want to come across as cold or like I didn’t care, so I started
      being more patient and checking in with her when she looked stressed. I’d
      try to crack a joke or help her with the tasks to make her feel at ease. I
      think what worked was just being present and calm, not trying to fix her,
      but just showing her, I had her back. If I could do anything differently,
      I’d probably talk to her more directly about what support she actually
      needs. Everybody handles pressure differently, and being a good team
      member means adjusting to support the people around you, not just doing
      your own thing.
    </p>

    <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
    <p>
      Writing this made me realise how much I’ve actually learned outside of the
      classroom. Life’s taught me alot about people, pressure, and myself. I’ve
      got a long way to go, but I’m backing myself to keep showing up and
      learning, one step at a time.
