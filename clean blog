Values, Strengths & Struggles
Before I started this course, I never thought I’d be sitting here writing a blog about values and self-reflection. I’ve spent most of my adult life working with my hands, building cars/engines, fabrication and driving trucks, figuring things out the hard way. But this learning journey is already pushing me in different ways, not just with tech, but with how I see myself.

A Time I Had to Make a Call
A while back, my best mate told me his partner had cheated on him. I just kept quiet. I didn’t want to get in the middle of their relationship, and honestly, I thought, “It’s his life, he’ll figure it out.”
But then it happened again. I could see how much it was messing with him, and I couldn’t just sit on the fence anymore. I told him straight, “Bro, I’m not gonna tell you what to do, but I’ll be really disappointed if you get back with her again.”
It wasn’t about judging him or pushing him away. I just care about him, and it hurt seeing him going back to someone who didn’t respect him. I said it from a place of loyalty, not control, it’s his life after all. I didn’t want to stay silent and watch him go through the same heartbreak and mental games again without saying anything.
Looking back, I’m glad I said something. He ended up walking away from her, and later told me that conversation helped him finally see it for what it was. Sometimes being a good mate means saying the hard stuff, even when you know it might hurt.

My Culture & The People Around Me
I grew up in West Auckland, bouncing between different places. It was a mixed environment, some good, some rough, but it was full of real people. I didn’t have much guidance growing up and ended up moving into my own place at 16/17. That taught me to figure things out on my own early. I still feel like I’m trying to figure things out.
Even without a clear path, I always had this feeling deep down that things like family, respect, and staying humble actually mattered. You show up, do your part, and look out for others, that’s what stuck with me.
Most of the people around me were friends and workers, just doing what they had to do. Being around them shaped the way I think. You don’t get respect from talking big, you earn it by work ethic, how you treat people and how you carry yourself, day in and day out.

Strengths I Bring to the Table
I don’t give up easily. I’ve been pushed, over worked, and still managed to show up the next day and keep pushing. I also love figuring things out even if it takes me awhile. That curiosity keeps me going when the code isn’t working or when I hit a wall. Another strength is I know when I don’t know something. I’ve got no shame in asking for help. I’d rather learn properly than pretend I’ve got it sorted.

The Things I Struggle With
I overthink. Simple as that. Sometimes I get in my own head, trying to make things perfect instead of just getting something finished. That slows me down. Also, I didn’t grow up coding or using computers much, so sometimes I feel like I’m behind. Like everyone else already knows things I don’t. But I’m learning to ignore that voice and just focus on getting a bit better every day.

Working With Others Under Pressure
At my current job, there’s a female worker on the team who would often get overwhelmed when things got busy. She’d get flustered and stressed out, and I struggled to relate. For me, I don’t see work as something to stress over. At the end of the day, it’s just a job, it’s not my company, (maybe id feel differently if it was) and I’ve always felt like my energy is better spent on my family and the things that really matter in life.
At first, I didn’t really understand her reaction. I thought, “Why’s she letting this get to her?” But over time, I realised that not everyone sees things the way I do, and some people genuinely feel that pressure more. I didn’t want to come across as cold or like I didn’t care, so I started being more patient and checking in with her when she looked stressed. I’d try to crack a joke or help her with the tasks to make her feel at ease.
I think what worked was just being present and calm, not trying to fix her, but just showing her, I had her back. If I could do anything differently, I’d probably talk to her more directly about what support she actually needs. Everybody handles pressure differently, and being a good team member means adjusting to support the people around you, not just doing your own thing.
Wrapping Up
Writing this made me realise how much I’ve actually learned outside of the classroom. Life’s taught me alot about people, pressure, and myself. I’ve got a long way to go, but I’m backing myself to keep showing up and learning, one step at a time.
